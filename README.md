Challenge 1: https://editor.p5js.org/maxxkeoni219/sketches/IkKeSOAKf

In challege one, I created my preliminary catcher, along with the background of my game. I mostly used, arc(), ellipse(), rect(), and beginShape() functions to create my background and person.

Challenge 2: https://editor.p5js.org/maxxkeoni219/sketches/JrzRk_kaQ

In challenge 2, I created a change in my sprite that makes angry eyes when the mouse is pressed. 

Challenge 3: https://editor.p5js.org/maxxkeoni219/sketches/zdDbtm2a2

In my challenge 3, I created a pizza that will fall from the sky when the sketch is run. I created the pizza from rect(), ellipse(), and triangle().  Using the pizza speed variables, the pizza falls from the sky at a random speed, and spawns at a random x location.

Challenge 4: https://editor.p5js.org/maxxkeoni219/sketches/gqYQLrIyL
In challenge 4, I was able to change when the pizza would fall. Instead of falling as soon as the sketch is run, it now falls when I click my mouse. I also implemented the start and gameover screen that activate and reset the game on mouse click. 

Challenge 5: https://editor.p5js.org/maxxkeoni219/sketches/8FuRbdGIF
In challenge 5, I finalized the game by making the pizza reset when it is caught in the mouth of the pizzaman. I created a collision area for the pizza to catch in the mouth of the pizzaman. I also added timers and counters in the top corners so you cant see your score, and how much time you have left.
